Hello, here is my triangle categoriser! Never wonder which type of triangle you're looking at again.

This is an express.js project, with one api endpoint:

/triangle?a=[x]&b=[x]&c=[x], where 'x' is a number value representing the length of a triangle side.

Start the server on port 3000 with these commands;
npm i
npm run start

This url will show the responses:
http://localhost:3000/triangle?a=[x]&b=[x]&c=[x]
